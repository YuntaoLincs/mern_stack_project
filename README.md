# A mern stack application

### Just finish the front-end page part in 29/02/2024

The front-end page is built with React, and the back-end is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Here is the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/learn/). In the course, I learned how to build a full-stack application with the MERN stack. The application is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting places and modify their posts. The app has a login and register page, and the user can only modify their posts after they log in. The app also has a map page that shows all the interesting places that users have posted.

Rather than using JavaScript, I used TypeScript to build the front-end page.
